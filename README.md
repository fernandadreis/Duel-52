# Duel-52
One day I was scouring the internet for a fun game of cards and I came across the game Duel 42. This game was created by Judd Madden and Nina Riddell, you can find it at http://juddmadden.com/duel52/ I just love this game and decided to use it as a base for a programming project, so I hope that one day this repository will be a simple version of this game.
